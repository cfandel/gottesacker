                          % - 2 = random inlets + load from file. Uses nb_RandomInlets
                          %   to know the number of random inlets and then uses
                          %   importanceFactor as in case 1.
                          % - 3 = load from file (xyc) and class the inlets
                          %   by catchment surface (3th column of the file)
                          % - 4 = mix of 1 and 3 -> random inlets + loaded inlets
